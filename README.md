# calculator

This program creates a functional calculator, which can do the following operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponents, factorials, and square roots.

The calculator accepts input either by clicking the buttons or pressing the corresponding keys.
    -The only action that cannot be achieved by keyboard input is square root "√". It must be clicked.
    -The "Cl" button is bound to delete on the keyboard.

To begin using the calculator you must first turn it on by either clicking the Pow button or pressing the P key on your keyboard.

The "Cl" button will clear the current display and the "←" functions as a backspace removing one character at a time.

Limitations of the calculator include the following:

    -Multiple Exponents cannot be chained together, such as 3^3^3. You would have to process 3^3 hit ENTER/= get an answer of 27 and then press ^3.

    -Exponents cannot be decimals. It is mathematically possible to calculate, but goes against mathematical convention.

    -Exponents cannot be square root calculations. Ex: "3^√9".

    -After hitting ENTER an answer cannot be squared. The square root key must be pressed before a number is typed.
